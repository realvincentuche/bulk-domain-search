# Bulk Domain Search
Search bulk domains with your favorite domain extensions.

**Demo:** https://realvincentuche.github.io/bulk-domain-search/

## Implementation
This is built with alpinejs and boostrap 4 calling a server that checks each domain availability.

## Steps Involved
- Get list of domains (without their extensions) each on a separate line.
- Select each of the available extensions to search against.
- Call the server api on each of the domain combination pairs
- Collate all results before displaying on the web page

## Future Steps
- Get more domain info not just their availabilities.
- Option to filter only available domains, etc.
